# Date-Inference-Calculator
This calculator gives you the exact date based on the initial date and the interval that you provide. The interval can be positive or negative, which means that the calculator can make both forward and backward inference. The code in the views.py is excerpted from the original file which includes the core algorithm of the date inference calculator. Since it is a Django web application, I only choose to present the core algorithm here for you to review.
